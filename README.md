## eCommerce CMS
[Demo](https://ecommerceprodmockup.web.app/)

Simple ecommerce cms platform. Made to practice React skills.

The idea was, to build a simple online shop cms where admin can login and manage products and orders. Products can be added, removed or deleted from database. As a dummy backend I've used firebase as db and auth provider.

It's not a "production ready" platform, but listed below functionalities are working as intended.
<ul>
  <li>Add/remove products from cart</li>
  <li>Place orders</li>
  <li>Login as admin (pass in placeholder)</li>
  <li>Add products to db/shop</li>
  <li>View/edit/remove products</li>
  <li>View/edit/remove orders</li>
  <li>Upload image drag and drop</li>
</ul>

Technologies used:
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Redux</li>
  <li>Firebase</li>
</ul>
